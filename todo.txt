set up routing and views super basic
make sure images are hosted by ME (put them in static folder), if not hosted by me could cause issues also j bad practice


different pages:
Home - the user's home page. here they can add meals or items to track their different. initially we will make this a manual process
    goal is to connect some sort of free nutrition API or make my own DB of items to choose from
    however, always should have option to create a new item that hasn't been used before

    if user not authenticated, route them to getstarted or login

getStarted - prompts the user to sign up.

Login - login page, authenticate users
    should also have the option to either "sign up" or get started or something if user doesn't have an account

SignUp - sign up page, create an account with us and register the user in our database

Logout - not really a page, but should log user out and be available as a button only to users that are currently logged in
    prolly will direct people to getStarted or login

improtant things to keep in mind:
navbar is the same design in all pages, however, contents will be different depending on if user is logged in or what page they are on.
 (could probably do this is base.html like from the tutorial)

 different navbar options on each page, should maybe take out of base.html 
 (keep navbar design but have a block that is replacable for navbar content)
